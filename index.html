        This is a small app made in vanilla javascript that simulates
        a genetic algorithm.
    </b>

    <p>
        On the upper left corner we can see the current generation of
        the population as well as its average fitness. We define fitness
        as how close a point, or individual, is to the box below.
    </p>

    <p>
        As the generations pass we can see how the bulk of the points move
        closer to the box, eventually having some points reach the box
    </p>

    <p><b> In general, </b> genetic algorithms work by defining an initial population,
        with random characteristics. After some time the generation is evaluated based upon
        a fitness function, and the fittest individuals of the population are more likely to
        pass on the characteristics to the next generation. This repeats itself until either
        the average fitness of the population is reached or a set number of generations happens.
    </p>

    <p><b> In particular, </b> in this implementation we define an initial population</p>
